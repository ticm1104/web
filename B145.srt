[PART 1]

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,700
I've got a quiz here about money.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,600
Would you like to do it with me?

4
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:10,070
Sure, what's the first question?

5
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:11,470
Here it is.

6
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:15,170
The smallest coin in the
United States is the cent.

7
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:17,730
How much does it cost to make 1 cent?

8
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:18,870
1 cent?

9
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,800
Well, that's not much.

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:27,770
I think it probably costs something
like 0.0001 cent to make it.

11
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,130
Is that right?

12
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,730
Completely wrong.

13
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:35,070
It costs two point four cents

14
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,230
What?

15
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,130
So the value of a cent is
less than it costs to make 1.

16
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:41,270
That's right.

17
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:46,430
And it costs 5.7 cents to
make a 1 dollar banknote.

18
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:50,970
A US dollar costs twice as
much money to make as a cent.

19
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:53,570
But it's worth 100 times more.

20
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:54,800
Funny, isn't it?

21
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,600
Funny?

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,800
That doesn't make any sense.

23
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,430
OK.

24
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,000
Here's another one.

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,430
How much of the world's money is real?

26
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:04,900
What do you mean real?

27
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:08,000
I mean, actual coins and banknotes.

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,430
Things you can touch.

29
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:12,570
Because a lot of our
money isn't really there.

30
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,370
It's computer data.

31
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:18,630
We use online bank transfers
or bank cards a lot of the time.

32
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:19,770
I see.

33
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,070
I'd go for 50 per cent.

34
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:23,230
Something like that.

35
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:24,330
Wrong again.

36
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:28,930
Only 8 per cent of the money we
use is actually something we can touch.

37
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:31,800
The rest is just numbers on a screen.

38
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,270
Wait a minute.

39
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,830
So maybe in the future,
we will be using bank

40
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:39,430
cards more and we'll be
doing more online shopping.

41
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:42,630
That means that we
might not have real money.

42
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:43,600
Yes.

43
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,000
Money won't be a thing we
can touch or carry around.

44
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,230
It won't exist in the real world.

45
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:52,130
We will just send data from
one computer to another.

46
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,030
That's crazy.

47
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,330
So what is money then?

48
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,830
Good question.

49
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,430
Here's another one.

50
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:02,670
How many trees are cut
down to make banknotes?

51
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:05,170
Oh, probably lots.

52
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:09,100
So that's why it's good if there won't
be so much real money in the future.

53
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:13,030
No, the answer is zero.

54
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,330
Banknotes aren't made of paper.

55
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,230
They're usually made of cotton or linen.

56
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,470
The same stuff as your t-shirt.

57
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:25,300
And at the moment, seven countries
only use banknotes made of plastic.

58
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,900
And that's increasing too.

59
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,500
I'm not doing very well
with these questions.

60
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,570
Don't worry.

61
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,900
Neither did I.

62
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,300
Here's one last question.

63
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,100
How many banknotes have some
kind of bacteria or virus on them?

64
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,170
Dirty banknotes?

65
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,400
I imagine they can't be very clean
because so many people touch them.

66
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,470
Maybe 95%.

67
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,700
Yes.

68
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:53,670
Actually, 94% of banknotes have
some kind of bacteria on them.

69
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:58,070
Over a nine-year period,
some British banknotes will

70
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:02,270
have gone through 2,328
different pairs of hands.

71
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:08,600
And did you know that the flu virus
can stay on a banknote for up to 17 days?

72
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,830
That's horrible.

73
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,800
I'll definitely be using my
bank card from now on.

74
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,500
[PART 2]

75
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,030
Welcome back to Money Spinners.

76
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:26,800
And our next contestant is Cindy Jones.

77
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,770
Hello, Cindy.

78
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,800
Here's your first question.

79
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:33,570
Good luck.

80
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:37,870
Which country has coins
with holes in the middle?

81
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:43,700
Is it Britain, Iceland,
Japan, or South Africa?

82
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,370
Oh, I know this.

83
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,600
It's Japan.

84
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,430
For sure.

85
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,300
I was there last year.

86
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:51,430
Yes, you're right.

87
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:54,930
So you have £100, well done.

88
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:58,970
Just out of interest, which
Japanese coins have holes?

89
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The 5 and the 50 yen coins, I think.

90
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,430
Absolutely right.

91
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,830
But you've still only got £100.

92
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,370
So, okay.

93
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:13,900
Here's your next question for £250.

94
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:20,600
Which day of the week is the one
when most people use a cash machine?

95
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:27,600
Is it Monday, Thursday,
Friday, or Saturday?

96
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:33,870
Well, of course I don't
know, but I'll guess.

97
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:36,430
I think it's probably Friday.

98
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:36,930
Why?

99
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:41,130
Well, it's the start of
the weekend, isn't it?

100
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:45,770
So I think that's when people
most want some money to spend.

101
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,430
It's a good guess, Cindy.

102
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,970
And it's correct.

103
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,500
Around the world, more
money is taken out of cash

104
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:58,000
machines on Fridays than
any other day of the week.

105
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:04,330
Okay, Cindy, you have £250
and here's your next question.

106
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:07,670
We all know that most
of the money in the world

107
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,430
doesn't exist as actual
coins and bank notes.

108
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:15,000
It's just numbers, figures,
and computer records.

109
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:20,830
But what percentage of all the
money in the world is coins and notes?

110
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:27,830
Is it 8%, 12%, 20% or 50%?

111
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:35,530
Hmm, it can't be as high as 50,
and I think 20% is very high too.

112
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:39,130
So 8 or 12?

113
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:44,970
Well, I'm sure it's a low
percentage, so I'll say 8%.

114
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:53,230
You say 8%, and that is absolutely right.

115
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,500
That puts you at £500.

116
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,830
Well done.

117
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,200
How do you feel?

118
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,470
Actually, I'm pretty calm now.

119
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,770
Great.

120
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:08,000
Okay, question 4 for £1000.

121
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:14,070
We often talk about paper money, but
many bank notes are made of plastic.

122
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:20,170
Which country was the first country
to produce plastic bank notes?

123
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:25,470
Is it Sweden, Germany, the US or Australia?

124
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,770
I know this.

125
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:28,870
I read it somewhere ages ago.

126
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,630
It's Australia.

127
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:31,700
Sure.

128
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,030
It's for £1000.

129
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:36,130
I'm sure.

130
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,300
And it's the right answer.

131
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:44,130
And it's got you £1000.

132
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:48,270
Okay, this is where it gets serious.

133
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:52,000
A wrong answer now, and
you'll leave here with nothing.

134
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:52,970
I know.

135
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,570
Okay, so here's your next question.

136
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:58,900
Remember, you don't have to answer it.

137
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:03,900
What's the name of the
world's first known coin?

138
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:08,530
In other words, the oldest coin
in the world that we know of.

139
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:19,330
Is it the Egyptian lira, the Lydian lion,
the Ying Yuan, or the Saxon shilling?

140
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:22,430
No idea at all.

141
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:27,930
It's probably Ying Yuan,
but no, I really don't know.

142
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:30,670
I'll take the £1000, please.

143
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:31,700
Fair enough.

144
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:37,930
Cindy Jones, you have won £1,000!

145
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:46,130
And Cindy, if you'd said Ying Yuan,
you would have lost your money.

146
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:50,530
The correct answer is B, Lydian lion.

147
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:52,400
Applause please for Cindy Jones.

148
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,130
[PART 3]

149
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:58,370
Money matters.

150
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:01,400
It's said that the
easiest way to be really

151
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:05,430
rich is to be born into
a really rich family.

152
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:10,930
That aside, undoubtedly, the best way
to become truly wealthy is to get a good

153
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:17,670
idea for a product, make it and sell it,
then sit back and watch the money come in.

154
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:22,700
Throughout history, many people
have become incredibly wealthy that way.

155
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,400
There's nothing new in this.

156
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,300
For centuries, people have had ideas,
made things and become very rich,

157
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:34,900
but questions are increasingly
being asked about the way we're going.

158
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:40,930
How fair is it for one person to have a
personal fortune of billions of dollars?

159
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:44,430
Is it right for big company
bosses to be paid huge

160
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:48,530
salaries and often to receive
large bonuses on top of that?

161
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:53,130
In just one year, the
head of a building company

162
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:58,270
in the UK received 75
million pounds in bonuses.

163
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,570
Is that acceptable?

164
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:05,030
In 1978, bosses in the UK's
biggest companies earned on

165
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:09,870
average about 30 times an
ordinary employee's salary.

166
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:13,200
In 1988, it was 47 times.

167
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:20,200
But by 2020, this had
increased to 133 times.

168
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,170
We'd like to hear your
comments on this subject.

A.

170
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:30,970
I left school with a guy I know, and
we went to work in a finance company.

171
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:35,030
His father’s one of the
directors, so now he's got a

172
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:39,130
very well-paid job, earning
five times as much as me.

173
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:42,900
By the time he's 30,
he'll have earned millions,

174
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:47,100
and he does everything
he can not to pay tax.

175
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,900
It's sickening!

I'm not sure what the problem is.

It's just how the world is.

180
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:01,600
Like the article says,
there's nothing new here.

181
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,300
Some people get lucky, some don't.

182
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,030
Look at writers.

183
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:09,070
Lots of people get an idea
and write a book, or books, and

184
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:14,500
sometimes thousands of people
buy the book and the writer gets rich.

185
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,200
They're not even always the best writers.

186
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,330
That's just how it is.

One time I heard a politician
say it's fine for people

190
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,770
to be extremely rich, as
long as they pay their taxes.

191
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,100
I agree.

192
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,970
A top boss, after ten years
of work or so, will have given

193
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:41,130
millions of pounds back
in taxes to help the country.

194
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,900
And that benefits everyone, right?

197
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:53,070
My mum's a doctor, and
she'll be working until she's 60.

198
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,270
35 years of work.

199
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:57,930
And when she stops, she
won't have made a tenth

200
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:00,430
of what some of these
people make in a year.

201
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:03,330
And there are people
who manage the hospitals

202
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:07,470
she works in, who earn
five times what she does.

203
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:14,030
Who contributes more to healthcare, a
doctor, or someone who works in management?

204
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,100
It's disgraceful.

00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:26,730
Money, past, present, and future.

208
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:30,570
Thousands of years
ago, people started using

209
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:35,330
metal coins as money
to buy and sell things.

210
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:41,000
But the coins were heavy,
so paper money was invented.

211
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:44,800
Different payment systems
evolved through time,

212
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:48,300
and now we also use
credit and debit cards.

213
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:56,700
These cards often have to be put into a
machine, and then a PIN has to be tapped in.

214
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,870
But that practice is
disappearing, with contactless

215
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:06,700
cards and smartphone apps
becoming more and more popular.

216
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:12,670
So cash has mostly been replaced
by alternative payment methods.

217
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,700
And things don't stop there.

218
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:21,570
It's possible that some countries
will soon be completely cashless.

219
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,370
For example, it's
predicted that no one in

220
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:31,230
Sweden will be using
cash at all by about 2025.

221
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:35,330
So, what is the future of money?

222
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:40,170
20 years from now, will
we still be using cash?

223
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,400
The answer is undeniably
no, and it's highly likely

224
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:49,130
that bank cards are
on their way out as well.

225
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:51,530
This is happening already.

226
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:57,030
The use of smartphones, smart
watches and electronic wristbands

227
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:03,970
has allowed people in many
situations to avoid using cash or cards.

228
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,770
Some apps let us transfer money
from phone to phone like a text message,

229
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:17,400
which makes it a quick and easy way
to repay a friend if you owe them money.

230
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:23,930
Increasingly, people are making invisible
payments for things like car rides.

231
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:27,230
You choose a car, you
take the ride, the money

232
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:30,700
automatically comes out
of your registered card.

233
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:36,100
You can even include a
tip for your driver this way.

234
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:41,870
Perhaps we will soon be doing
this in places like supermarkets too.

235
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:47,270
You'll get your goods, a reader will
record the details of what you've bought

236
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:52,370
as you leave, and and the amount will be
taken automatically from your account.

237
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:56,470
And if you need a refund,
the money is put back

238
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:01,900
in your account as
easily as it was taken out.

239
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:05,430
Worry free shopping,
no machines or long

240
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:10,930
checkout queues, no more
heavy wallets or purses.

241
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:17,570
This all sounds very positive, but
there are possible disadvantages too.

242
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,970
Technological advancement,
as we all know, brings many

243
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:27,730
positives, but also forces
us to consider other matters.

244
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:32,400
Will fraud, especially online, get easier?

245
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:37,370
And as our money systems become
more dependent on computers,

246
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:42,600
how can we make sure
that the computers don't fail?

247
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:50,530
Security might get better as we increase our use
of things like fingerprint and face identification,

248
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:58,530
but will they be used to invade our privacy
by gathering information about our movements?

249
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:03,700
By far, that's the most important question.

250
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:07,530
Questions like these won't go away easily.

251
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:14,370
We are in a state of change, and there
are many different future possibilities.

252
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:18,300
Perhaps unimagined payment
methods will be developed.

253
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:24,470
It will be interesting to see how things
move forward, but one thing is for sure.

254
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:28,900
In 20 years time, we
won't be buying, selling,

255
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:32,700
and paying the same
way that we do now.

257

You will hear Connor talking about
the royal mint, where coins are made.

258
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:51,870
For questions 1-10, complete the
sentences with a word or short phrase.

259
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:55,430
I'd like to talk to you
today about the royal mint.

260
00:15:55,430 --> 00:16:01,500
I should explain that I'm a numismatist,
which means my hobby is collecting coins.

261
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:04,600
That's why I'm so
interested in the royal mint.

262
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,770
It's where all the UK's coins are made.

263
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:14,500
The headquarters of the royal mint is in
South Wales in a town called Llantrisant.

264
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:19,630
I've never been there, but I've
seen photos and it looks amazing.

265
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,170
It's massive.

266
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:24,330
There's no bigger mint
on the planet, and it uses

267
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:28,870
the most amazing technology
to produce the coins.

268
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:34,630
One thing I should mention is that
not all the UK's money is made here.

269
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:37,570
The banknotes are made
by the Bank of England,

270
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:41,770
which is a different
organisation altogether.

271
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:45,100
The royal mint is also extremely old.

272
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:49,930
It was started during the
reign of King Alfred in 886.

273
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:54,030
That's more than 1,100 years ago.

274
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:58,970
At that time, there were several
mints all over the country, but

275
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:05,270
in 1279 all coins were made in
one place, the Tower of London.

276
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:12,370
The mint stayed in London until 1968
when it moved to its current site in Wales.

277
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:17,030
The new buildings were
opened by Queen Elizabeth II.

278
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:21,500
As I've already said, the
royal mint is a really big place.

279
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:27,870
It takes up 35 acres, which is
about the size of 23 football pitches.

280
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:33,300
It's also a huge employer
offering jobs to 900 people.

281
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:38,530
As you can see, it's really
important for employment in the area.

282
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:47,870
Work at the site goes on for 24 hours
a day, 7 days a week, 52 weeks a year. it literally never stops.

283
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:53,100
So it’s not surprising that it has
the potential to produce 90 million

284
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:59,330
coins a week, which means its
yearly output is around 5 billion coins.

285
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:03,570
Of course, that's more coins
than the UK needs each year.

286
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,930
The mint also makes coins
for other countries, around

287
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:11,130
60 countries in all get
their coins from the UK.

288
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:13,930
So far, I've only
talked about coins, but

289
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:17,630
the royal mint makes
other products as well.

290
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:22,270
One of the things it produces
is something called a blank.

291
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:25,200
A blank is a metal disc
which is the size of a

292
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,930
coin but doesn't have
anything printed on it.

293
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:33,430
Blanks can be made into coins
somewhere else at a later date.

294
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:39,100
The mint also produces medals and coins to celebrate special occasions.

295
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:43,670
They're always limited editions
and can become quite valuable.

296
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:46,970
These are the coins that got
me interested in the hobby.

297
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:51,670
I started in 2012, which was a good
year because the mint made special

298
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:57,430
coins to celebrate the Queen's Diamond
Jubilee and also the London Olympics.

299
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:59,530
I've got them both.

300
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:04,070
Talking of collecting, the royal mint
has an amazing collection of its own

301
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:09,270
with examples of almost all the coins
it's produced since the 16th century.

302
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,930
It keeps them in the
Royal Mint Museum and

303
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:16,270
you can see most of
them on its online pages.

304
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:21,170
Unfortunately, you can't visit the
museum in person to see the collection.

305
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:24,970
In fact, you can't visit the mint at all.

306
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,230
Until a few years ago, you could
have a guided tour around the

307
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:32,800
museum but they stopped them
