00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:12,770
Hey everyone, welcome back to English on the Go - the podcast where you learn everywhere and speak everywhere.

2
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:16,380
I’m Brian, and I’m so glad you’ve tuned in today.

3
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:25,180
Today, we are tackling a huge topic. It is something that stops so many of us from achieving our goals, especially when learning a language.

4
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,320
It is called perfectionism.

5
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:34,560
We often think that in order to be proud of our work, or to speak English confidently, we have to be flawless.

6
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:44,100
We tell ourselves, “I will speak when I don’t make grammar mistakes, ” or “I will show people my project when it is 100% perfect. ”

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,880
But the truth is, waiting for perfection often means waiting forever.

8
00:00:48,880 --> 00:01:03,430
In today’s episode, 
we’re talking about 
"How to Accept Imperfections 
and Stay Motivated". 
We will learn why "done is better than perfect" 
and how to be proud of your effort, 
not just the result.

9
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:06,300
Before we start, I have a question for you.

10
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:13,530
Have you ever hidden a project, or stayed silent in a conversation, because you were afraid it wouldn't be perfect?

11
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,450
And do you tend to be "hard on yourself" when you make a small mistake?

12
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:27,740
Think about that as we listen to our guests, Lisa and Sam. Lisa is struggling with a big presentation, and Sam is there to help her change her mindset.

13
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:31,010
Alright, let’s dive into the conversation.

14
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:42,560
Let’s join Lisa and Sam. 
It looks like Lisa is having a very stressful afternoon at the office.

15
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:52,420
Hey Lisa, are you okay? You’ve been staring at that same slide for about twenty minutes. You look like you’re trying to burn a hole in the screen with your eyes.

16
00:01:52,420 --> 00:02:06,550
Honestly, Sam? No, I’m not okay. I am stressing out. I have to send this presentation to the client by 5 PM, and it is just not ready. It’s a disaster.

17
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:13,460
A disaster? Let me look. 
Lisa, this looks fantastic. 
The data is clear, the graphics are nice. What exactly is the problem?

18
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:32,480
The problem is the font on slide 14. It doesn't look quite right next to the image. And the transition between slide 5 and 6 feels a bit clumsy. I keep moving this text box two pixels to the left, then two pixels to the right. I just can’t decide.

19
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:38,970
Lisa, you are obsessing over pixels. Do you think the client is going to measure the distance between the text and the image?

20
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:53,210
Maybe not consciously. But they’ll feel it, won’t they? If it’s not perfect, they might think I’m unprofessional. They might think I’m lazy. I just want it to be flawless so they can’t criticize anything.

21
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:58,990
Ah, I see what’s happening here. You’re not worried about the font. You’re worried about being judged.

22
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:15,920
Well, yes. Isn’t that normal? I want to be proud of my work. And I can’t be proud of it if I know there are flaws. It feels like if I send it now, I’m admitting defeat. I’m admitting that I’m not good enough to make it perfect.

23
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:23,010
That sounds exhausting. 
You know there’s a name for this, right? 
It’s called "paralysis by analysis".

24
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:25,260
Paralysis by analysis?

25
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:41,990
Yes. It’s when you overthink something so much that you actually stop moving forward. You become paralyzed. You are so busy analyzing the tiny details-the font, the pixels, the transitions-that you are failing to do the main job, which is simply to communicate your ideas.

26
00:03:41,990 --> 00:04:00,170
That... actually describes exactly how I feel. I feel stuck. I feel paralyzed. I’ve been working on this for three days, but I feel like I haven’t made any real progress because I keep changing the same small things over and over again.

27
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:07,290
Exactly. You are running on a hamster wheel. You’re working hard, sweating, and tiring yourself out, but you aren’t going anywhere.

28
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:18,130
But Sam, if I don't aim for perfection, what should I aim for? Mediocrity? I don't want to be known as 
the person who does "average" work.

29
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:32,040
There is a huge space between "average" and "perfect". You can do excellent work without killing yourself over invisible details. The problem is that your standard for "good enough" is impossibly high.

30
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:39,780
Maybe. But it feels safe. If it’s perfect, no one can hurt me. 
No one can say I made a mistake.

31
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:58,830
That’s the trap, Lisa. You think perfection is a shield that protects you from criticism. 
But actually, perfection is a cage. It keeps you trapped in this office, stressing over a font size, when you could have finished an hour ago and gone home to relax.

32
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:02,330
When you say it like that, it sounds pretty terrible.

33
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:24,080
It is terrible! Because while you are polishing this one stone until it shines, 
the rest of the building isn't getting built. You are sacrificing your peace of mind-and your deadline-for an illusion. Perfect doesn't exist, Lisa. It’s a ghost you are chasing.

34
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,340
So what do I do? Just send it with the "clumsy" transition?

35
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:34,960
We’ll get to that. But first, you have to admit that this fear isn't about the quality of the work. It’s about your fear of not being enough.

36
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:49,670
Sam is really challenging Lisa’s mindset there. It’s tough to hear that your hard work is actually a form of fear. Let’s see how Sam explains the alternative.

37
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:52,770
Lisa, let me tell you a quick story. You know I play the guitar, right?

38
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:58,120
Yeah, you’re really good. I heard you play at the company party last year.

39
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:04,330
Well, thank you. But for the first two years that I was learning, nobody heard me play a single note. Not even my wife.

40
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,150
Really? Why?

41
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:19,960
Because I was exactly like you are with this presentation. I told myself, "I will not play for anyone until I can play this song perfectly". I practiced the same song, "Wonderwall", for six months.

42
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,100
Six months on one song? That’s dedication.

43
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:46,260
It wasn't dedication, Lisa. It was fear. Every time I missed a chord change, or if my finger slipped and made a buzzing sound, I would get angry. I’d stop and start over. I refused to play through the mistake. I wanted to be a robot, not a musician.

44
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,820
So what changed?

45
00:06:47,820 --> 00:07:07,220
I met a guy at a music shop. He heard me practicing and he said, "Man, you’re playing that like you’re taking a math test. Where’s the feeling?" I told him I was trying to get it right. 
And he told me something I’ve never forgotten. He said, "Done is better than perfect".

46
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:12,570
Done is better than perfect? That sounds like an excuse for laziness.

47
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:26,490
That’s what I thought, too! But he explained it. He said, "If you play a wrong note, but you keep the rhythm going, people will still dance. 
If you stop to fix the note, the music dies".

48
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:30,220
Wow. That’s... actually a really good point.

49
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:39,950
It changed everything for me. I started playing "imperfectly". I missed notes. I messed up chords. But I finished the songs. And you know what happened?

50
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,180
You got better?

51
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:59,980
I got way better, and much faster. Because I was playing more. I wasn't stuck on the first measure of the song anymore. I was learning the whole song. I realized that "perfection is the enemy of progress". By trying to be perfect, I was stopping myself from growing.

52
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:08,600
"Perfection is the enemy of progress". I feel that right now. I’m definitely not progressing with these slides.

53
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:21,910
Exactly. Think about your presentation. What is the goal? Is the goal to have the most beautiful slides in the world? Or is the goal to give the client the information they need to make a decision?

54
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:27,730
The goal is to give them the information. And to persuade them to approve the project.

55
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:32,970
Right. So, if the font on slide 14 is slightly different, will they still understand the information?

56
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:33,960
Yes.

57
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,710
Will they still be persuaded by your excellent data and your passion?

58
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:40,300
I think so. The data is strong.

59
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:55,940
Then the slide is "done". It serves its purpose. If you spend another three hours on it, the data won't change. The persuasion won't change. The only thing that changes is that you will be more tired and stressed when you deliver it.

60
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:03,380
You’re right. I’m diminishing returns here. I’m putting in 100% effort for maybe 1% improvement.

61
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:09,720
Or zero percent improvement. Sometimes we "fix" things until we actually ruin them. We over-edit.

62
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:18,990
Okay, I see the logic. But emotionally... it’s still hard to let go. It feels like I’m lowering my standards.

63
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:34,150
You’re not lowering your standards, Lisa. You’re shifting your focus. You are prioritizing "impact" over "appearance". You are choosing to be effective instead of being flawless. And honestly, effective is much more valuable.

64
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:48,310
This conversation is getting really interesting. Sam is sharing some great wisdom. Let’s pause for a moment to look at the vocabulary they used.

65
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:56,440
"/bi hɑrd ɑn jʊrˈsɛlf/"
"Be hard on yourself."
This phrase means: to criticize yourself too much or treat yourself strictly.

66
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:01,140
For example: “Lisa is being very hard on herself about the presentation. ”

67
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:06,020
Or: “Don’t be so hard on yourself; everyone makes mistakes. ”

68
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:15,530
"/pəˈræləsɪs baɪ əˈnæləsɪs/"
"Paralysis by analysis."
This is a great idiom. It means: overthinking a situation so much
 that you never take action.

69
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:21,570
Example: “Sam told Lisa she was suffering from paralysis by analysis. ”

70
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:26,740
Or: “We need to make a decision now and avoid paralysis by analysis. ”

71
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:34,000
"/ˈflɔlɪs/"
"Flawless."
This is an adjective meaning: perfect; without any mistakes or defects (flaws).

72
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,890
Example: “Lisa wants her slides to be completely flawless. ”

73
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:43,090
Or: “Her English pronunciation is almost flawless. ”

74
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:50,040
"/mɛs ʌp/"
"Mess up."
This is a common phrasal verb meaning: to make a mistake or to do something badly.

75
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,980
Example: “Sam used to worry that he would mess up the chords on his guitar. ”

76
00:10:54,980 --> 00:11:00,150
Or: “It’s okay if you mess up sometimes; that’s how you learn. ”

77
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:06,420
"/wɝk ɪn ˈprɑɡrɛs/"
"Work in progress."
This implies that something is not finished yet, or is still being improved.

78
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:11,800
Example: “Sam realized that his guitar playing was a work in progress. ”

79
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:16,550
Or: “Don’t judge my painting yet, it’s still a work in progress. ”

80
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:24,210
Great job. Now, let’s go back to Lisa and Sam and see if Lisa can actually find the courage to click "send".

81
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:38,730

So Lisa understands the logic that "done is better than perfect". 
But overcoming the emotional fear is a different story. Let’s see how she handles it.

82
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:56,020
Okay Sam, I understand the guitar analogy. And I understand that my slides are technically "functional". 
But I still have this knot in my stomach. 
What if I make a mistake during the actual talk? What if I stutter or forget a number?

83
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:00,040
Then you stutter. And then you look at your notes, find the number, and keep going.

84
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:07,300
But that’s so embarrassing! I want to look like I have everything under control. 
I want to look professional.

85
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:11,360
Lisa, let me ask you something. Who are the people you admire most in this office?

86
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,640
Well, I really admire Sarah, the marketing director. She’s amazing.

87
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,900
Okay, Sarah. Does Sarah ever make mistakes?

88
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:30,860
Hmm. Actually, yes. Last week in the town hall meeting, her microphone stopped working, and then she realized she had the wrong graph on the screen.

89
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,850
And what did she do? Did she cry? Did she run out of the room?

90
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:46,290
No. She laughed. She said, "Whoops, looks like technology wins today", and she just explained the numbers from memory. She actually made a joke about it.

91
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:50,690
And did you think she was unprofessional? Did you think she was a failure?

92
00:12:50,690 --> 00:13:01,480
No! I actually thought she was really cool. She seemed so confident because the mistake didn't rattle her. It made her seem... human.

93
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:13,250
Exactly! That is the secret. We don't connect with perfection. We connect with humanity. We connect with authenticity. When Sarah laughed at her mistake, she showed you that she was real.

94
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:21,090
That’s true. If she had panicked, it would have been awkward. 
But because she owned it, we all relaxed.

95
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:37,510
Precisely. This is what I call embracing the "messy middle". 
Learning and working is messy. It’s not a straight line. When you try to hide the mess, you look stiff and fake. 
But when you embrace the mess, people trust you more.

96
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:41,890
So you’re saying that mistakes can actually be... good?

97
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:56,930
Mistakes are data. That’s how I look at it now. When I play a wrong note, it’s just data telling me, "Hey, your finger position was a bit off there". It’s not a judgment on my soul. It’s just information.

98
00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:01,550
Mistakes are data. I like that. 
It takes the emotion out of it.

99
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:13,370
It does. And remember, nobody is watching you as closely as you are watching yourself. You are looking at your presentation with a microscope. The client is looking at it from a distance. They care about the big picture.

100
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:19,980
I guess I am being a bit narcissistic, thinking everyone is obsessing over my font choices.

101
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:34,860
It’s not narcissism, it’s just anxiety. But yes, the reality is that people are busy. They want your ideas, not your perfection. They want to know what you can do for them. 
If the package is a little "rough around the edges", but the content is valuable, they will buy it.

102
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:42,490
Authenticity over perfection. 
Value over appearance. 
I’m starting to feel a little lighter, Sam.

103
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:50,920
Good. That’s the goal. You have done the work. The substance is there. 
Now you just need to trust that the substance is enough, without all the perfect wrapping paper.

104
00:14:56,090 --> 00:15:04,030
It looks like Lisa is finally ready to let go. But taking that 
final action-clicking send-is the hardest part.

105
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:12,000
Okay. I’m looking at the email. The file is attached. My finger is hovering over the "Send" button.

106
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,260
Do it. Don’t check it one more time. 
Just send it.

107
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:17,680
It’s scary. It feels like jumping off a cliff.

108
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:26,340
It’s not a cliff, Lisa. It’s just an email. But tell me this: regardless of the font or the transition, are you proud of the work you did this week?

109
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,700
Am I proud?

110
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:32,130
Yeah. Did you research hard? Did you come up with good strategies? Did you put your heart into it?

111
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:41,580
I did. I worked really hard on the strategy section. I think the ideas are really solid. They could actually help the client a lot.

112
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:52,020
Then be proud of that. Be proud of the effort. Be proud of the courage it takes to share your ideas. 
Don't wait for the client to say "Good job" to give yourself permission to feel proud.

113
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:59,390
You’re right. I’ve been waiting for external validation. I’ve been thinking, "I'll be proud if they like it".

114
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:05,590
But you can choose to be proud right now. You can say, "I did my best, I created something valuable, and that is enough".

115
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:12,850
I did my best. And "done is better than perfect". Okay. I’m going to do it.

116
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,880
On the count of three. One, two, three...

117
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,410
Click. Gone. It’s sent.

118
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:21,290
There! How do you feel? Did the world end? Did the roof collapse?

119
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:27,900
No. Actually... I feel... relieved. 
It’s out of my hands now.

120
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:32,850
And you should feel proud. You defeated the "paralysis by analysis". That is a victory.

121
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:41,130
It is. And you know what? Looking at the sent email... I don’t even remember which slide had the "bad" transition.

122
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,400
See? It was never important.

123
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:50,870
Thanks, Sam. I think I’m going to go home now. And maybe... maybe I’ll be okay with being a "work in progress".

124
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:57,490
That’s the best thing you can be. A work in progress is always growing. A perfect thing is stagnant. Be the work in progress.

125
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:06,240
I will. Hey, maybe you should bring your guitar to the office sometime. I’d love to hear you play "Wonderwall", mistakes and all.

126
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,390
Deal. But only if you promise not to judge my chord changes.

127
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:12,110
I promise. I’ll just enjoy the music.

128
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:25,380
I love that ending. Lisa finally clicked send! Let’s review the final set of vocabulary from their conversation.

129
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:34,130
"/kʌt jʊrˈsɛlf sʌm slæk/"
"Cut yourself some slack."
This is a fantastic idiom. It means: to be less critical of yourself; to give yourself a break.

130
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:40,500
For example: “Lisa needs to cut herself some slack and stop worrying about every pixel. ”

131
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:46,120
Or: “You’ve been working for 10 hours; cut yourself some slack and go home. ”

132
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:53,720
"/rʌf əˈraʊnd ði ˈɛʤɪz/"
"Rough around the edges."
This phrase describes something that is good overall, but not perfectly finished or polished yet.

133
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:59,520
Example: “Sam said it’s okay if the presentation is a little rough around the edges. ”

134
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,850
Or: “Her English is fluent, but her grammar is still a bit rough around the edges. ”

135
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:11,120
"/ɪts nɑt ði ɛnd əv ðə wɝld/"
"It’s not the end of the world."
This is used to say that a problem is not as serious as it seems.

136
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,770
Example: “If you make a mistake, it’s not the end of the world. ”

137
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:22,240
Or: “I missed the bus, but it’s not the end of the world; there’s another one in 10 minutes. ”

138
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:30,760
"/ˌɔθɛnˈtɪsɪti/"
"Authenticity."
This is a noun meaning: the quality of being real or true, not copying others or pretending.

139
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:36,190
Example: “Sam believes that authenticity is more attractive than perfection. ”

140
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:39,930
Or: “People appreciate the authenticity of her speech. ”

141
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:48,110
"/oʊn jʊr mɪˈsteɪks/"
"Own your mistakes."
This means: to accept responsibility for your errors openly, without making excuses.

142
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:53,040
Example: “Sarah owned her mistake with the microphone and laughed about it. ”

143
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:57,540
Or: “The best way to learn is to own your mistakes and move on. ”

144
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:01,530
Alright - that wraps up our main conversation for today!

145
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:09,550
In the next part, I’ll share a fun fact about why clumsy people might actually be more popular than perfect people. Stay with me.

146
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,320
Before we wrap up, here’s something fascinating that proves Sam was right.

147
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,240
Psychologists have studied something called The Pratfall Effect.

148
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:28,230
A "pratfall" is a funny mistake, like slipping on a banana peel or spilling coffee.

149
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:35,670
In a famous study, researchers showed participants two people. Both people were very intelligent and competent.

150
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:42,620
But one person was "perfect", and the other person was competent but spilled a cup of coffee at the end of the interview.

151
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:45,180
Guess who the participants liked more?

152
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,770
They liked the person who spilled the coffee!

153
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:55,290
The study showed that small mistakes make competent people appear more human, more relatable, and more likeable.

154
00:19:55,290 --> 00:20:02,420
When someone is too perfect, they can seem distant or threatening. But a small imperfection breaks the ice.

155
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:12,350
So, the next time you make a mistake in English, or trip over your words, just remember: you might have just made yourself more likeable!

156
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,910
Alright, let’s take a moment to look back on what we’ve learned today.

157
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:33,270
First, we talked about The Trap of Perfectionism. We saw how Lisa was stuck in "paralysis by analysis", believing that perfection was a shield against judgment.

158
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:44,120
Then, we learned the powerful mantra: "Done is better than perfect". Sam showed us that trying to be flawless stops us from growing, just like it stopped his guitar playing.

159
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:51,430
We discussed Embracing the "Messy Middle". We learned that mistakes are just data, not failures.

160
00:20:51,430 --> 00:21:03,180
And finally, we saw that you can Choose to Be Proud Now. You don't have to wait for a perfect result. You can be proud of your effort, your courage, and your authenticity.

161
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:09,090
Remember, perfection is stagnant, but a "work in progress" is always growing.

162
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:17,500
And that’s it for today’s episode of English on the Go.

163
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,480
I hope today’s talk helped you feel a little lighter.

164
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:28,940
I hope it gave you the permission to release a project that is "good enough", or to speak English without worrying about every single grammar rule.

165
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:33,700
Remember, your goal is connection, not perfection.

166
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:44,480
Don’t forget-you can download the free PDF vocabulary list for this episode. It includes all the idioms like "cut yourself some slack" and "paralysis by analysis".

167
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:51,540
